# CS-300-Final-Project
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This course explored a wide range of essential topics, particularly in the areas of algorithm design, analysis, and implementation. I learned to assess the efficiency of algorithms through the use of Big O notation and engaged with key data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables. In addition, I examined various techniques such as sorting, searching, and recursion. The course was centered on applying these concepts to solve complex challenges, thereby laying a solid groundwork for future studies in computer science.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand?

My initial focus was on studying and diligently working to comprehend the core concepts of data structures, algorithms, and Big O notation. It is imperative to engage in regular practice. I take the necessary time to analyze each problem, outline my approach with pseudocode, and incrementally write my code while performing tests along the way. Grasping the intricacies of data structures is crucial, as they efficiently organize and store data, which allows for swift access, manipulation, and processing. The choice of the right data structure can markedly improve a program's performance, leading to more optimized and scalable solutions.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When confronted with any issues or difficulties, my first step would be to analyze the problem by dividing it into smaller, more manageable parts. I would ensure that I dedicate adequate time to fully comprehend each segment of the issue. After this breakdown, I would focus on reconstructing the problem, supported by thorough research and information sourced from Brightspace or by seeking different viewpoints online. I will refrain from proceeding until I am entirely confident in my understanding of the situation. Lastly, I understand the value of taking breaks as needed; sometimes, a brief pause can provide a fresh outlook that significantly enhances my problem-solving process.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Engaging in this project has significantly transformed my approach to software design and development. It has enhanced my understanding of selecting and utilizing appropriate data structures and algorithms tailored to various tasks. I have adopted a more meticulous planning process, focusing on optimizing my code for efficiency and scalability from the outset. Furthermore, this experience has underscored the necessity of deconstructing intricate problems into manageable components and continuously refining my solutions.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Participation in this project has contributed to my development as a programmer by prioritizing the creation of code that is easier to maintain, read, and modify. I have gained insights into structuring my code more logically, selecting intuitive names for variables and functions, and adding explanatory comments to clarify the code's intent. Moreover, I have become adept at crafting designs that support future changes or enhancements without necessitating a complete restart.
